# pandas_challenge

This is the fourth challenge for UOB data analyist bootcampus.\n\n

Which I dont understand is why I change PER STUDENT BUDGET into "$,..f" format.\n
because I need to cut dataframe base on this column\n
And I googled how to change it back\n
Finally I use Original Data to replace this column and cut the DataFrame\n
WHich cost my 10 min I believe\n
XD
