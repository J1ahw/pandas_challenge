# pandas_challenge

This is the fourth challenge for UOB data analyist bootcampus.

Which I dont understand is why I change PER STUDENT BUDGET into "$,..f" format.
because I need to cut dataframe base on this column,
And I googled how to change it back.
Finally I use Original Data to replace this column and cut the DataFrame.
WHich cost my 10 min I believe.
XD
